                <p>This week's topic is about Scrape, which is one of the valuable skills in computer learning. Nowadays, society is full of information on the Internet, and almost everyone has more or less information stored in their computers. How to make good use of this information is a question that deserves careful consideration, but first we need to access it effectively. Through this week's course, I have practised this way of accessing it myself.
            </p>
                 <p>For this week's work, I chose Wikipedia as the address to access the information (from which we can easily access information in text and links). For the topic, I chose Nature, and I was thinking about how interesting it would be to code out the words described in the word life in Nature.

                 <p> 
                I followed the practical steps from simple sentence filtering to link fetching, and I implemented the information capture process step by step. For further work, I hope to use these sentences containing the word 'life' to put together some interesting images or to create some new computer expressions. In my imagination, the content I have acquired is like an encyclopaedia of computer life, which will take us through the hidden groups of creatures in 'computer nature'. At the same time these sentences are derived from reality and can also be used to reflect on real-life forms of life.
            </p>  
                <p> 
                In conclusion, learning to capture data online can be a valuable skill for a range of applications, and it is a technical direction with great potential for artistic creation, which I am fortunate to have been able to complement with this study.
